# Friends-Tricker
Simple python programs to trick friends! (Still updating, 1/5)

## **_psg_tricker.py_**

To start, install the packages by typing the following commands to the command prompt, one by one:
```pip install PySimpleGUI``` and ```pip install sys```.
After installing the packages, type the following command to the command prompt to run the program:
```python3 psg_tricker.py```
When started, this program will pop up a window that tells the victim to admit he/she is dumb. If they don't admit it, the program will keep running until the victim finally admits it. Try it out yourself!
